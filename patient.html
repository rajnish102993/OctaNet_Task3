      <h2>Support for hospital patients and associated factors</h2>

    </section>

    <p><b>Background: </b>During hospitalization patients need support 
      from nursing staff. To improve the delivery of support during
       hospitalization, it is necessary to know more about how patient
        background factors and organizational factors are associated with patients` 
        perceived access to support.</p>

    <p><b>Aim:</b>This study describes hospital patients' perceived access to 
      emotional and informational support from nursing staff. A further 
      concern is with the associations of patient background factors 
      (e.g. age, education, mode of admission) and various organizational factors 
      (e.g. nurse to bed ratio, skill mix) with support.</p>

    <p><b>Methods: </b>A quantitative research approach was applied. 
      The data were collected from patients (n = 731) at a Finnish university 
      hospital using a specially developed scale. The sample of hospital patients 
      was drawn from the population by stratified random sampling. In addition, 
      data were retrieved from the hospital's electronic database.</p>

    <p><b>Results:</b>During their stay in hospital, patients felt they received 
      more emotional than informational support. Outpatients and elective inpatients 
      reported receiving more support than inpatients and emergency patients. Having 
      a named nurse was also positively associated with access to support. Staffing 
      levels showed a positive association with patient access to support. On the other 
      hand, the availability of support deteriorated when the number of emergency 
      inpatients and the unit workload increased.</p>

    <p><b>Conclusion:</b>Steps are needed to improve the provision of 
      informational support to nursing care patients and to assess the 
      methods of support provision. Patient support can also be improved 
      by adopting the named nurse system. There is a significant association 
      between organizational factors and patient access to support, which 
      warrants further investigation.</p>
