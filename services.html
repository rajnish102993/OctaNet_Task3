        Hospital services are the foundation of a hospital's services. They are
        frequently influenced by the demands or wishes of the hospital's key 
        users, with the goal of making the hospital a one-stop or core institution 
        of the local community or medical network. Hospitals are facilities with 
        basic services and personnel—usually medicine and surgical 
        departments—that provide clinical and other services for specific 
        diseases and ailments, as well as emergency care. Hospital services 
        include everything from basic health care to training and research for
        major medical school centres, as well as services created by a network 
        of industry-owned institutions such as health maintenance 
        organisations. <br><br>
